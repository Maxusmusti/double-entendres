New obesity study looks for larger test group.
Criminals get nine months in violin case.
A price to make your sausage sizzle.
I decided to walk to the sea today.
The weather is quite nice.
I hate the winter.
I like how his balls drop.
It's so hard.
Make sure it's long enough.
Take it out slowly.
I think it's stuck.
I'll blow all of them at once. 
What is Easter?
Travel is restricted for the Holidays.
Yeah, look at my face, look at that joy; This is one sided, yeah, I can't lie; We ain't gon' work out, we a fat boy; Yeah, sumo, got it, memo
Pedal to the metal; Lost footin', it was sugar in my gas tank
They ain't build me up so I block 'em like Lego
Mayonnaise-colored Benz, I push Miracle Whips
I build mine off fed time and dope lines; You caught steam off headlines and co-signs
I'm high and I'm bye; wait, I mean I'm straight
Survive the drought, I wish you well
You could date a stick of dynamite and wouldn't go out with a bang
You ain't gonna sell two copies if you press a double album
I send cars to your crib like I'm a cab dispatcher
